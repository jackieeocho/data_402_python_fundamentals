# PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS

This repository contains Python scripts and examples covering basic Python fundamentals for beginners.

## Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.

###  Hello World

The "Hello World" program is a simple script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It is often used as the first program to demonstrate the basic syntax of a programming language.

For example:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Common built in python functions
```
txt.len()
```
This helps us get the length of a particular object.
```
txt.capatilise()
```
It capitalises the first letter 
```
txt.upper()
```
This capitalises every character in the string.
```
txt.replace()
```
This removes or changes a particular character.
```
txt.append()
```
This adds an item to the end of a list.
```
txt.pop()
```
This removes the last item of a list, or a specific item when the index is specified.
```
txt.index()
```
This searches for a specific  object within your list and gives you the output of the position index of the object searched.

#### LIST : allows you to create a list of objects, and can be a mix of data types. Lists are index based and always start from [0].

#### DICTIONARY: they are based on key value pairs {key,value}, we can assign a particular key to a dictionary that it will use to store information

#### VARIABLE : is a reserved memory location that allows us to store data types and objects. It helps to organise data within code.

#### CONCATENATION : joining strings together to form new strings.
